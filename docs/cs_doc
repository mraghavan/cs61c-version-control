cs is a wrapper around git that syncs your local work with work on your server.

Here's how you use it:

The argument [assignment] means if you don't specify assignment, cs will
try to use the current directory as [assignment]

cs done-server [assignment]
    configure the server to accept pushed changes. Use this after use-server
    when your work on the server is done

cs get <assignment>
    download the master copy of <assignment> to both the server and your
    local directory.

cs lookup [flags]
    looks up your grades using the glookup program; passes [flags] directly
    to glookup.

cs pull [assignment]
    pull all committed changes from the server.

cs push [assignment]
    push all committed changes to the server. If [assignment] is not specified,
    push uses the current directory to determine the assignment

cs submit [assignment]
    push changes and submit [assignment].

cs update-server [assignment]
    updates the repository for [assignment] to the $SERVER; use this if the
    server you used to check out [assignment] is down and you want to be
    able to push and pull. To do this, you must change $SERVER in .csconfig
    to a functional server

cs use-server [assignment]
    configure the server for use (all this does is switches to the git branch
    br-[assignment]; this is done because local changes are pushed to this
    branch, not to master)
